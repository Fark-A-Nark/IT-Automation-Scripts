This PowerShell script is designed to identify and report user profiles on a Windows system that have not been used in the last 30 days, and optionally flag them for deletion. Here's a breakdown of what it does:


------ Purpose ------
To audit local user profiles and determine which ones are inactive (not used in the last 30 days), excluding certain system or default accounts.



------ How it works ------


Configuration

	$days = 30: Sets the threshold for inactivity.
	$excludedAccounts: Lists accounts that should be ignored (e.g., Administrator, Guest).

Profile Retrieval
	Uses Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_UserProfile to get all user profiles.
	Filters out special system profiles (Special -eq $false).


Profile Analysis

	For each profile:
		Extracts the username from the profile path.
		Converts LastUseTime to a readable date.
		Calculates how many days since the profile was last used.
		Checks if the profile is older than 30 days and not in the excluded list.
		Flags profiles for deletion if they meet the criteria.


Output

Displays a formatted table of all profiles with:
	Profile Name
	Last Log-In Date
	Whether it was used in the last 30 days
	Whether it's scheduled for deletion
	Lists the usernames of profiles scheduled for deletion.

Exits with code 1 if any profiles are flagged for deletion, otherwise exits with 0.
